OIL_SEPARATION MOD READEME
(NICI) = Not in creative inventory

PURPOSE:
This MOD adds a physical method for extracting oil from an agricultural product. The process 
is intended to be labor intensive and to consume the excess seeds produced from farming.
This MOD changes how crops in the farming mod drop their harvest. Instead of dropping both harvest
and seed, mature crops will drop one seed and one-three harvest. Imature crops only drop one seed.
This mod makes use of the crop_blight mod (which can be enabled or disabled in the init script).
Crop_Blight adds a crop disease which kills crops, trees, and other flora. 

FEATURES:
Oily seed paste is crafted from the seeds. 9 seeds = 1 oily seed paste. Oil can be extracted from
oily seed paste by placing the seed paste underwater and placing a flame node one block away from
the seed paste. If the STRAINER mod is enabled, the strainer can be used to extract oil.
 - Oil can be picked up using a bucket
 - Oil floats on water
 - Oil is flammable
 - Oil buckets can be used as fuel
 - Oily seed paste dries out in direct sunlight
 - If flames are near the seed paste at the moment the oil separates out, there is a chance you
   can collect more than one oil source from the node.
